# avisynth_script_generator
A batch AviSynth script creation tool

To use this tool, you just run it, & open a folder with lots of videos you want to create AviSynth scripts for. By default, it opens only '.mp4', '.mkv' & '.avi', but you can add more extensions if needed.
You can toggle on/off the resize & noise filters.
